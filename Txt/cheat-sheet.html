#Julien Pontbriand (2135020)    Oct. 29, 2022    File creation. Importing all of my notes from my Joplin application.

### REVISION HISTORY FOR THE ACTUAL CHEAT SHEET (VALUES ENTERED IN THE JOPLIN APPLICATION) ###

My way of creating the CheatSheet was to store every class's pertinent information
 that was not included in the coding session files inside in a note in my 
Joplin application. I usually use Joplin (https://joplinapp.org/) to take my 
class notes since it can store pictures and files as well, is Open Source and 
manages all of my devices. I then transfered everything here on the 
 29th of october.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 1:

Try-catch is not for validation, it's to catch errors and log to them.
X : An [ideographic] letter referring to [cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux)]
A : Apache or its expanded form, Apache HTTP Server (Web server, most popular because of it's ease of use)
M : MariaDB (formerly [MySQL(oracle)]
P : PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) (Most popular server-side programming language)]
    Comparable to JSP (Oracle) or ASP (Microsoft)
    Html is static
    Php: programming language (that can be used to generate html code!)
P : Perl : (Scripting language) : for nightly tasks (everynight, do this, etc.)] We will not use it this semester

8.1.6 / PHP 8.1.6

Hash / signature / checksum / digest = They all mean the "sum" of the bits with a specific algorithm

Rhash for windows : very nice tool to check hash on windows command lines, especially sha1 encryption
https://sourceforge.net/projects/rhash-for-windows/

I found out I'd rather use the Get-Hash function of Powershell

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 2:

Password vs Hash :
data       password     encrypted hash (does not contain the password!)
lasalle    abc          asd13f13f132d

What is a port? It's basically the address of the software!
When you type a column (:) in the url of a browser, you can force the port to use for the connection
HTTP : 80
HTTPS: 443
127.0.0.1:8000/ == localhost

C:\xampp\htdocs = PUBLIC FOLDER! (You may have a private one that automatically copies files to the public folder.
Linux = /opt/lampp/htdocs

2 main differences ( \ / , drive letters vs root)
Windows : backslash to separate folders \
others ( linux, apple, websites) : forward slash ///

In windows, there is a drive letter, unlike in Linux, where there's the root folder
No maximum of drives in linux

XAMPP is NOT secure for production: all the doors are opened.
Good tool to learn how to build websites though :)
Not secure and not stable, because it's not a real service

Service or Daemon is a software that is launched automatically even before the user asked for it (explorer.exe?)

Command to see network activity in windows : netstat -ab (requires elevation)

On Linux, you can run files properly without their extensions!

Keep index name the same so the user don't have to click anything (uses default page)

Bad html can lead to low SSO optimization

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 3:

Links : interesting browser on Linux without a UI
Chrome is the most used browser in the world

Adblock Plus is a good ad blocker
When you test a website, you have to test it on several browsers 

Project properties : run configuration to change default port for launching in Netbeans

Utf-8 (UNICODE) = Good encoding for letters. Only special characters will use 2 bytes.

3 steps to make sure encoding is international :

1- The file / database should use utf-8 encoding (its automatic in the new version of netbeans)
2- (most complex, semi-automatic) network headers (text/html; charset=UTF-8)
(MUST CREATE HEADERS BEFORE THE DOCUMENT HTML IS BEING SENT)
3- (auto) meta charset = utf-8 (add it to the header of the html)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 4:

Echo is a better command than print. Echo "abc".

See : https://www.diffen.com/difference/echo-vs-print-in-PHP

You can escape characters with \

EX : 'My boss said: "Don\'t run in the office"'

VARIABLES

$variable = 'allo'
double quotes work to include variables

Double quotes is 'smarter'

You can use concatenation

Php is an untyped language

Dot means concatenation

Echo is the tip of the iceberg

var_dump is an echo of the backend (type and memory)

print_r is more human readable, especially for complex variables

strlen for the lenght of the variable is to be used

left alt + 130 = e accute (careful, accents can take more memory)

character map


CONSTANTS
declare a constant : define("_NAME", VALUE);

Constants should be placed on top

You can open many <?php <?> blocks

mb_substr exists (multi byte, takes special characters as regular characters for character counts)
strpos and stripos


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 5:

Not so much has been recorded here. Most of the content that was pertinent was 
inserted directly into the php examples in various project files.

Round function exsists : ex round($x * $y, 2)

The 2 in the previous example tells us to floor ater the 2nd digit.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 6:

How to include other files

Functions cant be redeclared

Echoing stuff in functions is a bad practice

include 'phpFunctions.php';
include_once : good idea!

require : if includes fails,
require_once

You can have a tree of dependencies
To prevent that, use constants at the top of the document for pages

error_reporting(E_ALL)

php.ini : error_reporting (in xamp) _>

error_reporting (remove the ; )

Default Value: E_ALL

Development Value: E_ALL

Production Value: E_ALL

#ternary operator

#echo ($language == "English" ? "same" : "Nope");

Have CSS classes as small as possible!

Whan a ref starts with a /, it means RIGHT THERE relative to this files location

: ex -> /test.txt

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 7:

alt property for images is ALSO for search engines also SEO to be more efficient
(in addition to help visually impaired users or users that dont have access to 
the img for many reasons)

Switch for titles of pages or other html properties that need to depend on the page

It is important to check if vs code copy automatically to htdocs

in : C:\xampp\htdocs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 8:

XDebug : Do not install this on a production server

Good for debugging on development builds

1.  run phpinfo()
    
2.  go on xdebug.org/wizard and past the text copied on step #1
    
3.  follow instructions on the wizard :
    

1.  Download [php_xdebug-3.1.5-8.1-vs16-x86_64.dll](https://xdebug.org/files/php_xdebug-3.1.5-8.1-vs16-x86_64.dll)
2.  Move the downloaded file to C:\xampp\php\ext, and rename it to `php_xdebug.dll`
3.  Update `C:\xampp\php\php.ini` and add the line:
    `zend_extension = xdebug`
4.  Restart the Apache Webserver

5 ) add breakpoint in netbeans, in the bottom of the screen, if it hangs, click the x button and then click the Xdebug 3 buttons: it copies few lines in the windows clipboard
6 ) paste the lines in the php.ini

7.  Restart the Apache Webserver

GET

1.  Is used by the address bar (GET) as additional, PUBLIC parameters (NOT SECURE)
2.  Everything is saved in the history
3.  shorter max length possible
    
POST

1. Nothing is saved in the history
2. Secure for forms inputs

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 9:

Sometimes you want to give the power to the user to change the UI, ex DARK MODE
That's why GET is useful
for forms, NEVER use GET tho!

Network header : can redirect to another sidte if at the top
Once you start to write the page : dont put headers : they are for the network header at the start in an envelope
you cant say HEY BTW ... put this in the header. Once the letter is posted, it's posted and SEALED.

In the same fashion, you CANNOT start editing the html before the html tag

if you dont want to lose all that you typed

its a problem to use global variables directly, dangerous for injection?

#3 htmlspecialchars is the better of the validations,

except when you try with a $_POST, because you cant use it on results of expressions

1 filter input string
echo "<br>#1 " . filter_input(INPUT_POST, "make", FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
remove html tags

2 filter input FULL
echo "<br>#2 " . filter_input(INPUT_POST, "make", FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS);
This filter is used to escape "<>& and characters with ASCII value below 32

(USE THIS ONE) -> 3 htmlspecialchars (USE THIS ONE)
echo "<br>#3 " . htmlspecialchars($make);

4 htmlentities
echo "<br>#4 " . htmlentities($make);

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Class 10:

Types of errors

1 - syntax, compilation {} : refuse to compile / run
2 - runtime : ex : division by 0, permission

2a - Errors (cannot continue) : trigger_error("custom error")
2b - Exceptions : (can continue): ex x = 3 / 0, throw new Exception ("custom exception")

3- logical

Ex : price with age value in it

The bad thing with the try catch is that you have to write it everywhere, super time consuming

So in php, you can enable systemwide try catch!

you have to do it at the beginning

#include....

#complex way

function manageError($errorNumber, $errorString, $errorFile, $errorLineNumber)

{
echo "an error occured on the line $errorNumber in the file $errorFile: " . "errorString ($errorNumber)";
#save detailed error in the file
die();
}

#other better way

function manageException($errorObject)
{
echo "An error occured on the line ". $errorObject->getLine() . " of the file " . $errorObject->getMessage() . "(" . $errorObject->getCode() . ")";
}

(THIS IS LIKE THE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SAFETY NET, put it in the very start of the php file)

error_reporting(E_ALL);
set_error_handler("manageError");
set_exception_handler("manageException");

Similarity between XML and HTML
You can only have one tag containing all of the others
They are all markup languages
With HTML, you MUST respect certain words
With XML, any words for tags
XML has a DTD: document Type Definition

XHTML : The browser interprets the code
The browser even refuses to show you page if the page doesnt work

quirk mode :

XSLT :

eXtensible StyleSheet language
